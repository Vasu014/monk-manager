# Architecture Specification

## Overview
Monk Manager is built as a modular, extensible system that can be easily enhanced with new capabilities while maintaining high performance and reliability.

## System Components

### Core Components
1. **CLI Interface**
   - Command parsing and routing
   - User input handling
   - Output formatting

2. **AI Engine**
   - Model integration
   - Prompt management
   - Response processing

3. **Tracing System**
   - Logging infrastructure
   - Metrics collection
   - Telemetry processing

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment configuration
   - User preferences
   - Model settings

## Design Principles

### 1. Modularity
- Each component is self-contained
- Clear interfaces between modules
- Easy to extend with new capabilities

### 2. Observability
- Comprehensive tracing
- Detailed metrics
- Performance monitoring

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful error recovery
- Detailed error reporting
- User-friendly error messages

### 4. Configuration
- Environment-based configuration
- User preferences
- Secure credential management

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- Rust 1.70 or higher
- tracing for logging and telemetry
- clap for CLI parsing
- tokio for async runtime
- serde for serialization

### Performance Targets
- Command response time < 100ms
- Memory usage < 100MB
- CPU usage < 10% during idle

## Security Considerations
- Secure credential storage
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Resource usage limits
