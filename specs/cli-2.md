# Interactive CLI Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the primary CLI interface for `monk-manager`, which provides a direct chat-like interface with the underlying AI model. This mode creates a seamless, conversational experience for users to interact with the AI within the context of the current project.

## Command to Launch
```bash
monk-manager
```

## Behavior and Features

### 1. Session Initialization
- When launched, the interactive mode automatically sets the project root to the current working directory.
- A simple welcome message is displayed to inform the user that the session has started and shows the active project path.

### 2. Input/Output Flow
- **User Input**: 
  - Displayed in white text.
  - Single-line input is submitted with the `Enter` key.
  - Multi-line input is possible by pressing `CMD + Enter` (Mac) or `CTRL + Enter` (Windows/Linux) to continue typing on a new line.
  - Final submission requires a standalone `Enter` key on a line by itself.

- **AI Response**:
  - Displayed in green text.
  - Responses are shown concisely, without unnecessary prefixes or formatting.
  - Each response is clearly separated from user input.
  - Code blocks in responses are properly formatted with appropriate indentation.

### 3. Context Management
- The interactive session maintains context between messages within the current project.
- The AI can reference previous exchanges in the current session.

### 4. Commands and Control
- **Session Control**:
  - `CTRL + D`: Ends the interactive session.
  - `CTRL + C`: Interrupts current operation.

- **Special Commands**:
  - `/help`: Displays available commands and basic usage information.

### 5. Display and Formatting
- **Colors**:
  - AI responses: Green
  - User input: White
  - Status and error messages: Yellow/Red as appropriate
- **Terminal UI**:
  - Progress indicator shows when the AI is generating a response.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Interactive Loop
1. Implement basic REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):
   - Set up input reader with support for Enter and CMD+Enter handling.
   - Create output writer with colored text support.
   - Implement basic message exchange with the AI model.
   - Implement CTRL+D for session exit.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Input/Output
1. Add support for multi-line input with CMD+Enter.
2. Implement proper text coloring (white for user, green for AI).
3. Add progress indicator during AI response generation.
4. Implement basic code block formatting with indentation.

### Phase 3: Context and Help Command
1. Implement conversation context management within the current project.
2. Add support for the `/help` command with clear instructions.

### Technical Considerations

### Library Dependencies
- **termion** or **crossterm**: For terminal control and colored output
- **rustyline**: For enhanced line editing and history

### API and Model Integration
- Messages will include project context to make the AI aware of the workspace.
- The AI client will maintain state throughout the interactive session.

### Error Handling
- Network issues during AI requests should be gracefully handled with clear error messages.
- Input parsing errors should provide helpful guidance.
- The session should be resilient to unexpected input or responses.

## Future Tasks
- Session persistence
- Configuration options
- Multiple project support
- Security features
- Enhanced commands and shortcuts
- Version control integration
- Pagination for long responses
- Settings customization
- Split-screen mode for code and conversation
- Auto-completion
